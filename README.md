## this was an excellent practice in using pubsub in a code base that was NOT designed for it. That was a fun little refactor/brute force challenge. It wasn't 'that' bad, but it wasn't as clean as my basic example that I used before hand which was a single file app. -> everything was in script.js (in the prior example)

## while this example is less clean, it does make use of pubsub, and it does fix my circular dependacy issue, which I faced in the renderPeopleAdder demo.

## It may be rough, but i'm super impressed with the pubsub design, and I enjoy using it a lot.
